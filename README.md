Router Cipher - Encryption and Decryption Tool
Overview
This Java implementation provides a router cipher with both encryption and decryption capabilities, featuring skip and reset functionalities. The router cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the plaintext characters according to a specific routing pattern.

Features

Encryption: Convert plaintext to ciphertext using the router cipher algorithm

Decryption: Revert ciphertext back to original plaintext

Skip Functionality: Ability to skip specified characters during processing

Reset Feature: Reset the cipher state when needed
